This Arduino sketch uses the AFMotor and Servo libraries to control a robot with four DC motors. The motor movements are controlled based on serial commands received through the Serial interface. The commands are:

    'S' for stop
    'F' for forward
    'B' for backward
    'R' for right
    'L' for left

Key Components

    Motor Initialization:
        Four DC motors are initialized with AF_DCMotor objects.

    Setup Function:
        Serial communication is started.
        Motors are set to a speed of 150.

    Loop Function:
        Reads serial input and executes corresponding motor control commands.

    Motor Control Functions:
        right(), left(), reverse(), forward(), stop() control motor directions and actions.

Code Improvements

    Fix Syntax Errors:
        Change Void to void (lowercase) for function definitions.
        Replace If with if (lowercase).
        Replace Motor1 with motor1 and similarly for other motor variables.

    Optimize Serial Reading:
        Read serial data once per loop iteration and use it for decision-making.

    Correct Function Calls:
        Ensure all functions are called with lowercase (stop() instead of Stop()).

    Use Consistent Function Naming:
        Ensure function names are consistent (e.g., rotate() is defined but not used
